# image-classification-70-dog-breeds
So I found a dataset in kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/70-dog-breedsimage-data-set and built an image classification model with resnet with 96% accuraccy!
So I used image generator , resnet50 and another things that you can see them in the 70 dog breeds.py and also .ipynb
